# Welcome to Robonectics

I was tempted to call this project **Electronomicon**, but:

1. It was already taken as a Gmail address.
2. **Robonectics** polled a little higher for professionalism.

This site (or resource) is intended for **learners** of all backgrounds curious about robotics, electronics, and coding.

## About This Resource

I have volunteered at [Code Club](https://codeclub.nz/) for the last couple of years, working primarily with **Year 6 to Year 8** students in New Zealand schools. These notes are here to help them—and me—navigate our various **Robonectics** projects.

### Who Can Use This?

- **Students:** Especially those in **Years 6–8** (ages ~10–13), but younger or older learners are welcome too!
- **Educators & Mentors:** Anyone seeking quick references or activities for robotics and electronics.
- **Hobbyists & Tinkerers:** People of any age who love **hands-on** projects.

---

## Project Goals

- **Introduce** basic electronics and robotics concepts (e.g., wiring, sensors, motors).
- **Practice** programming in a fun, interactive way (e.g., Raspberry Pi, microcontrollers, line-following cars, etc.).
- **Encourage** creative problem-solving and debugging skills.
- **Empower** students to experiment and learn through trial and error.

## Topics Covered

1. **Line-Following Robots**  
   - Wiring motors and sensors  
   - Programming logic to detect lines  
   - Upgrading chassis and modules  

2. **Load Cell & Scale Projects**  
   - Reading sensor values with **HX711**  
   - Calibrating for accurate measurements  

3. **Code Club Activities**  
   - Block-based programming  
   - Python basics  
   - Collaboration and project showcases  

4. **Additional Electronics**  
   - LED circuits, resistors, breadboards  
   - Intro to microcontrollers (Arduino, Pi Pico, etc.)

## How to Use These Notes

- **Step-by-Step Guides:** Each project will have a walkthrough with code snippets, diagrams, and troubleshooting tips.
- **Markdown Format:** These notes are written in Markdown for readability and easy sharing.
- **Open Source & Adaptable:** Feel free to reuse or remix these materials in your own clubs or classrooms.

## Stay Tuned!

I’ll keep adding new sections, lessons, and project ideas. If you have questions or suggestions, don’t hesitate to reach out or open an issue on our GitHub (if applicable).

**Happy building and coding!**
